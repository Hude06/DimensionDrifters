Plot:
    A cosmic rift has caused the convergence of four distinct dimensionsâ€”Floral Eden, Mirage Wastes, Echo Plains, and Celestial Abyss. As a Dimension Drifter, you must navigate each realm simultaneously, battling interdimensional invaders and restoring equilibrium to the cosmic weave.
Floral Eden - Forest:
    Description: A lush and vibrant world filled with towering trees, exotic flowers, and magical flora. Giant mushrooms create a captivating landscape, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blossoms. However, lurking within the foliage are aggressive plant-based creatures defending their territory.

Mirage Wastes - Desert:
    Description: A vast desert realm with shifting dunes, mirages, and ancient ruins buried beneath the sands. The scorching sun casts an unforgiving heat across the landscape, and optical illusions make navigation challenging. Sandstorms bring mysterious creatures to life, blending reality and illusion.

Echo Plains - Plains:
    Description: An expansive, flat grassland where the wind carries echoes of the past. The ground is covered in soft grasses, and ancient stone monuments dot the landscape. Ghostly echoes of past events play out intermittently, offering clues to puzzles and challenges. The plains are inhabited by ethereal beings that embody memories.

Celestial Abyss - Space:
    Description: A cosmic void with floating islands, radiant nebulae, and breathtaking celestial phenomena. The landscape is both serene and treacherous, with gravity-defying terrain and portals to other dimensions. Enigmatic celestial beings guard the secrets of the universe, posing both allies and challenges to those who venture into the abyss.
